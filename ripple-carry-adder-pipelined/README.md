# Hardware Modeling Using Verilog - NPTEL

By Prof. Indranil Sengupta (IIT Kharagpur)  
Week 7 Assignment: 4-bit Pipeline Ripple Carry Adder  

Verilog module to implement a 4-bit pipeline ripple carry adder. The module takes as inputs two 4-bit numbers A and B,  a single-bit carry Cin and performs the bit-by-bit  addition operation at each positive edge of an input clock, Clk. At i-th stage of the pipeline the i-th bits from inputs A and B, and carry generated by previous i-1  stage will be used to generate i-th sum and carry bit. At the end of 4 such positive clock edges the resulting sum and carry will be available through a 4-bit Sum and a single-bit Cout output ports respectively.  

The adder module is implemented in such a way that users can provide new inputs at every clock period and after a initial delay of 3 clock periods get the desired output at a regular interval of 1 clock period.
